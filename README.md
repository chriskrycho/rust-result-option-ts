# Rust's `Result<T,E>` and `Option<T>` in TypeScript

Just what it says on the tin: I straight-up implemented the APIs defined for Rust's
versions of these common types in TypeScript, just for the sake of learning and
playing with TypeScript's type system.

- [`Option<T>`](https://github.com/chriskrycho/rust-result-option-ts/blob/master/option.ts)
